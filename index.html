          Murray makes his triumphant return with “The Bee Sting,” a tragicomic
          tale about an Irish family grappling with crises. The Barneses —
          Dickie, Imelda, Cass and PJ — are a wealthy Irish clan whose fortunes
          begin to plummet after the 2008 financial crash. But in addition to
          this shared hardship, all four are dealing with demons of their own:
          the re-emergence of a long-kept secret, blackmail, the death of a past
          love, a vexing frenemy, a worrisome internet pen pal and more. The
          novel threads together the stories of the increasingly isolated
          Barneses, but the overall tapestry Murray weaves is not one of
          desolation but of hope. This is a book that showcases one family’s
          incredible love and resilience even as their world crumbles around
          them.

          A dystopian satire in which death-row inmates duel on TV for a chance
          at freedom, Adjei-Brenyah’s debut novel — following his 2018 story
          collection, “Friday Black” — pulls the reader into the eager audience,
          making us complicit with the bloodthirsty fans sitting ringside. “As
          much as this book made me laugh at these parts of the world I
          recognized as being mocked, it also made me wish I recognized less of
          it,” Giri Nathan wrote in his review. “The United States of
          ‘Chain-Gang All-Stars’ is like ours, if sharpened to absurd points.”
          Amid a wrenching love story between two top competitors who are forced
          to choose between each other and freedom, the fight scenes are so well
          written they demonstrate how easy it might be to accept a world this
          sick.

          De Kerangal’s brief, lyrical novel, first published in France in 2012
          and newly translated by Jessica Moore, follows a young Russian
          conscript named Aliocha on a trans-Siberian train packed with other
          soldiers. The mood is grim. Aliocha, unnerved by his surroundings
          after a brawl, decides to desert — and in so doing, creates an uneasy
          alliance with a civilian passenger, a Frenchwoman. Their desolate
          environment — de Kerangal describes the Siberian landscape as “a world
          turned inside out like a glove, raw, wild, empty” — only heightens the
          stakes. “The insecurity of existence across this vastness and on board
          the train emphasizes the significance of human connection,” our
          reviewer, Ken Kalfus, wrote. “In a time of war, this connection may
          bring liberation and salvation.”
